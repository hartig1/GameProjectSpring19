    //My ideas are as follows:
    //The boss does not move from the side of the screen
    //It fires fireballs and flaming stones at you
    //Flaming stones will cool down, allowing you to pick them up and throw them at the boss
    //Touching the boss will hurt you

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
